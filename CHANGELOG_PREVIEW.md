## How the Auto-Generation Works:

1. **Conventional Commits** are parsed and categorized:
   - `feat:` → **Added** section
   - `fix:` → **Fixed** section  
   - `docs:` → **Documentation** section
   - `style:`, `refactor:` → **Changed** section
   - `perf:` → **Performance** section
   - `test:` → **Testing** section
   - `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:` → **Maintenance** section

2. **Non-conventional commits** (like "Working Authentication Step With Warnings.") get categorized based on keywords or go to **Fixed** by default

3. **Scopes** (like `auth` in `feat(auth):`) are preserved in the description

4. **Version sections** are created automatically when you tag releases (e.g., `v0.2.0`)

5. **Release dates** are automatically added in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
