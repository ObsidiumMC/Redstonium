## Quick Start

### Installation

#### From Releases (Recommended)
Download the latest binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OmarAfet/rustified/releases).

#### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OmarAfet/rustified.git
cd rustified

# Build and install
cargo install --path .
```

### First Launch

1. **Create your first instance:**
    ```bash
    rustified instance create my-instance 1.20.4
    ```

2. **Launch Minecraft:**
    ```bash
    rustified launch my-instance
    ```

The launcher will automatically handle authentication and download necessary files.

## Usage

### Version Management

```bash
# List available Minecraft versions
rustified list

# Show only release versions
rustified list --releases-only

# Filter versions and limit results
rustified list --filter "1.20" --limit 5

# Show installation status
rustified list --show-installed
```

### Instance Management

```bash
# List all instances
rustified instance list

# Create a new instance
rustified instance create <name> <version> [description]

# Delete an instance
rustified instance delete <name>

# Show instance details
rustified instance info <name>

# Set memory allocation (in MB)
rustified instance memory <amount>
```

### Game Operations

```bash
# Launch an instance
rustified launch <instance-name>

# Skip file verification for faster launch
rustified launch <instance-name> --skip-verification

# Prepare/download a version without launching
rustified prepare <version>
```

### Authentication

```bash
# Check authentication status
rustified auth status

# Clear cached authentication
rustified auth clear

# Force re-authentication
rustified auth refresh
```

### Java Management

```bash
# List detected Java installations
rustified java list

# Get recommended Java version for Minecraft version
rustified java recommend <minecraft-version>
```

## Architecture

Rustified is built with a modular architecture:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/           # Microsoft OAuth 2.0 & Minecraft authentication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/       # CLI command implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ launcher/       # Core launcher functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ files.rs    # Download manager with parallel processing
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.rs     # Game launch logic and argument handling
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ instance.rs # Instance configuration management
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ java.rs     # Java detection and version matching
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cli.rs          # Command-line interface definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ error.rs        # Custom error types and handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.rs         # Application entry point
```

### Key Components

- **FileManager**: Handles parallel downloads, SHA1 verification, and caching
- **GameLauncher**: Constructs JVM arguments and launches Minecraft processes
- **InstanceManager**: Manages instance configurations and settings
- **JavaManager**: Detects and manages Java installations
- **AuthManager**: Handles the complete Microsoft ‚Üí Xbox Live ‚Üí Minecraft auth flow

## Configuration

### Instance Settings

Each instance supports customizable settings:

```rust
// Instance configuration example
{
     "name": "my-instance",
     "version": "1.20.4",
     "description": "My custom instance",
     "settings": {
          "memory_mb": 4096,
          "java_args": ["-XX:+UseG1GC"],
          "resolution": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080}
     },
     "last_used": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Authentication Storage

Authentication tokens are securely stored in:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/rustified/auth.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/rustified/auth.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/rustified/auth.json`

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Git

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OmarAfet/rustified.git
cd rustified

# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build optimized release
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- list
```
